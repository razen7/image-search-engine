# Steps followed

## UI
- First, create the toolbar with the options needed. Figure out the selector how it is made and think in layers ðŸ˜‰

- Create the background and think about how to apply some overlay shading on the background image. 

- Create the loading indicator and think about which properties should change across a time within each interval.

- Think how to show the images in a flexible way yet systematic.

## JS
- Read the documentaion first and inspect every element within the response.

- Inspect which endpoints is needed as to acheive the functionality of fetching the stickers or the GIFs.

-Think about the code as if it is a state and you should update the GUI whenever this state is changed.
